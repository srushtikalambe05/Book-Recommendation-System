# Book Recommendation System

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Book Recommendation System** built using **Python**. It recommends books based on user preferences using collaborative filtering and other recommendation algorithms. The system leverages a dataset of books and user interactions to suggest similar books based on the user’s reading history.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a dataset named **BOOK DATASET.csv** which contains the following fields:
- **User-ID**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **Book-Title**: Title of the book.
- **Book-Author**: Author of the book.
- **Year-Of-Publication**: Year when the book was published.
- **Publisher**: Publishing house of the book.
- **Ratings**: Ratings given by users.

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before being used in the recommendation model.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for building recommendation models.
- **Git** for version control.
